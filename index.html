            <h3>After Work</h3>
            <p>I didn't do much today after getting off work at <b class="workplace">In-N-Out</b> I picked up food and groceries for my family and then started working on Lab 2 for CSE110. In Lab 2 I will be using HTML for the first time ever, I should've started earlier as many previous professors have said I should <em>"Start early, start often!"</em>.</p>

        <p> I started my off sleeping in till noon. Then I studied CSE 101 most of the day getting ready for a quiz that was due at midnight. Ended up taking the quiz and did better then I thought I would've. I might have even aced it if it wasn't for the dumb mistake I made with the bounds.</p>

        <p> After taking the quiz I celebrated one of my friends birthdays by going to her house with a small group of friends. We caught up and sang Happy Birthday. Ended up coming home around 11 PM and going to bed shortly after returning home.</p>

        <p>I spent all day catching up on lectures due to having to work during their synchronous scheduled times. What I am going to do for the rest of the night in order of importance:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Watch CSE 110 Lecture</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Watch Math 170A Lecture</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Start prepping for Quiz 1 in CSE 101</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>When thinking about taking the quiz for CSE 101, I try to stay positive and think <br><i>"I will do good!"</i>.</p>
