What did I work on yesterday?
Yesterday I worked on things for other classes so I didn't get a chance to start up Lab 3.

What am I working on today?
Today I am going to be working to finish Lab 3, specifically working to implement all the bullets in part two under the General CSS Topics tab and CSS Selectors tab.

What issues are blocking me?
The issues that are blocking me is that I am new to pull requests and using git hub in the way described in Lab 3. Additionally, I have never used CSS, General CSS Topics or CSS Selectors so this should be a challenge to improve my skills.\
